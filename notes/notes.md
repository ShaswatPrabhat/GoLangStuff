* Go is a compiled language
* Go run compiles the source code from one or more source files whose names end in .go, links it with libraries, then runs the resulting executable file.
* A package consists of one or more .go source files in a single directory that define what the package does.
* Package main is special.
* It defines the standalone executable from the language.
* Program does not compile on unused imports ( to reduce unneeded references )
* No semicolons needed unless we need to have two or more statements on the same line
* For loop is the only loop statement in Golang
* A map holds a s et of key/value pairs 
* Provides constant-time operations to store, retrieve, or test for an item in the set. 
* The key may be of any type whose values can compared with ==, strings being the most common example; 
* The value may be of any type at all.
* The order of map iteration is not specified, but in practice it is random, varying from one run to another. 
* This design is intentional, since it prevents programs from relying on any particular ordering where none is guaranteed.
