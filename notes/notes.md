* Go is a compiled language
* Go run compiles the source code from one or more source files whose names end in .go, links it with libraries, then runs the resulting executable file.
* A package consists of one or more .go source files in a single directory that define what the package does.
* Package main is special.
* It defines the standalone executable from the language.
* Program does not compile on unused imports ( to reduce unneeded references )
* No semicolons needed unless we need to have two or more statements on the same line
* For loop is the only loop statement in Golang
